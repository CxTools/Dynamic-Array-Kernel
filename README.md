# Dynamic-Array-Kernel 

Dynamic array for windows kernel development. I recently had to develop something similar to STL vector, but compatible in kernel mode, since I had chunks of unknown sizes coming in that I had to parse. So, I created this. I couldn't find anything like this anywhere online, except for GLib's [GArray](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Arrays.html) and [this](https://www.happybearsoftware.com/implementing-a-dynamic-array).

## Usage

    BYTE_ARRAY arr;
    InitByteArray( &arr );

    AppendElementsByteArray( &arr, (PVOID)someBuffer, (ULONG)someBufferLength );

    FreeByteArray( &arr );
